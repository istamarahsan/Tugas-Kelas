This is the Incomplete Library Smell. This code comes from a library that
provides an EmailService class. However, it isn't actually implemented.
Furthermore, it is just a single class.

We do not implement actual email, but we extract the interface (for the consumer of the library)
and provide a stub implementation. The instantiation is hidden behind a factory. Also, we removed the Main entrypoint method because this is a library.
