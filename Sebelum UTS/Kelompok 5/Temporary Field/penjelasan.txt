"totalPrice" was a variable that was completely dependent on another (the cart items). Thus whenever the cart needed
to be updated, that variable needed to be updated as well. In other words, totalPrice was just a function of the items.
Rather than risking keeping mutable state, we can just compute the total price whenever it is requested and remove
the field completely.
