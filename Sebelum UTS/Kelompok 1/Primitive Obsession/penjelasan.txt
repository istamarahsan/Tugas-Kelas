The character class is holding too many primitives i.e. weaponName, weaponType, armorName, and armorType. We can group them, like weaponName, weaponType into a class (Weapon) and armorName. armorType into a class (Armor).
By doing that we lower the use of primitives datatype. in this case are string datatype.
This increases the cohesion between the bits of data that were highly related (armor-related data, weapon-related data).
Additionally, we chose to represent the weapon and armor types as enums that are parsed on input, since it seems that these were actually limited options rather than actual strings.

Simply after we make them a new class we just construct a bit of the code, change some parameter into the class that we have made.
